{"google":"UA-30540366-1","body":"== DAT Format\r\n\r\nA gem for reading results from the  Mascot proteomics search engine. The format used by Mascot is a DAT file and is fully describe within the Mascot Installation and Setup guide. Matrix Science (http://matrixscience.com) does not support natively accessing the DAT file format, and instead urge developers to use their supported mascot_parser library for accessing DAT file information. \r\n\r\nThis project is in no way affiliated with Matrix Science, I just needed pure-Ruby tools to access DAT files, so I rolled my own. \r\n\r\nThis is open source software licensed under the MIT license (see below). As such I make no gaurentees about the quality or correctness of such. You have been warned.\r\n\r\nSee the Mascot::DAT class for more information on how to use this library.\r\n\r\n== LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Angel Pizarro\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
